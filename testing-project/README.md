## Editor pong!
This is the testing project for the editor, we use this to make sure that all of the editor functions are working as intended.

### why pong?
Glad you asked, while Amethyst is a high-performance ECS engine, running pong on it would be comparable to strapping a jet engine to a chessboard, this is only temporary, we just need something basic for the current editor MVP.

If you have anny ideas for the future editor testing project, forward them to #Editor chanel on discord and tag @Alve™ 🐈🐧#9010  

### Testing this
Make sure you have nightly installed:
```bash
$ rustup install nightly
$ cargo +nightly run --features vulkan
```
