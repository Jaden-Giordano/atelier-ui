First, you need to have the environment for Yarn and Yarn  
itself installed on your computer in order to build the .less files.

- How to modify / work.
everything that will be added or changed will be inside the "/custom" folder in uikit.
Do NOT try to modify the .css files, thease are only generated files, only change the .less files.

- How to use.

Use "yarn compile" inside "uikit/" directory, the compiler will output the editor theme in
"uikit/dist/css/uikit.amethyst-web-ui.min.css" then replace that in "editor/static/"
